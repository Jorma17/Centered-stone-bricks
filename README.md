# Centered-stone-bricks
I just fixed the annoying non-centered texture of chiseled stone bricks.

Download the texture pack from here: https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/centered-stone-bricks

This texture pack is licensed under the GPL3 license. This means you can modify this and even sell this. However, there's some restrictions:
If you include this texture in your own pack, you have to make the whole pack GPL3, granting others the same rights **or** you have to distribute this separately from your pack, keeping the license the same. The same also applies if you use this texture for mods etc.
